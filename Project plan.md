# Project plan for iteration 4 of hyperparameter tuning

It's been several years since I touched this project, so I think this would be a good time to restart the project from scratch.

# Part 1 - re-run learning rate optimization

# Part 2 - train some models based on that optimization

- [ ] Set up a test module in the trainer
- [ ] Set up the test step in pytorch lightning
- [ ] make sure I'm able to choose which test metric to use based on the dataset
