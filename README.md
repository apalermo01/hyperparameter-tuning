# hyperparameter-tuning
Experimenting with hyperparameter tuning on subset of dataset vs. full dataset


# TODO

- [ ] build a simple feed forward network
- [ ] build a simple convolutional network
- [ ] train both on mnist through simple training pipeline
- [ ] change learning rate hyperparameter, and other hparams in training
- [ ] implement data augmentation
